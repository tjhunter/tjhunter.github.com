## About

I am currently a software engineer at Databricks.

Prior to that, I did a Ph. D. in Machine Learning, in the 
Department of Computer Science at the
University of California at Berkeley. My advisors are [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Epabbeel/) and [Alexandre Bayen](http://lagrange.ce.berkeley.edu/bayen/).

## Projects

In the course of my work, I have created or co-created a few projects around data science and Machine Learning.


### Koalas

Koalas provides a pandas-like API and experience on top of Apache Spark. This dramatically helps the transition from "small scale" data science to "large scale" data science.

Website: [Github](https://github.com/databricks/koalas)

Announcement: [Databricks blog](https://databricks.com/blog/2019/04/24/koalas-easy-transition-from-pandas-to-apache-spark.html)

Presentations:
 - [Spark+AI Summit 2019]()
 - [Webinar]()

 
 ### Graphframes
 
 Graphframes is a distributed graph processing interface built on top of Apache Spark, it is the recommended Graph interface for Spark until a future inclusion inside Spark. This work was co-authored with Joseph Bradley.
 
 Website: [Github]()
 
 Presentations:
  - [Spark+AI Summit]()
  
  

- spark-sklearn: a collection of wrappers around scikit-learn

- TensorFrames: a low-level integration between Google Tensorfow and Spark

- Deep Learning Pipelines: a Spark MLlib-like interface that provides Deep Learning capabilities to Apache Spark.
