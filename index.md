With Markdown, it is possible to emphasize words by making them *italicized*, using *astericks* or _underscores_, or making them **bold**, using **double astericks** or __double underscores__. Of course, you can combine those two formats, with both _**bold and italicized**_ text, using any combination of the above syntax. You can also add a strikethrough to text using a ~~double tilde~~.

You can create [inline links](https://github.com) by wrapping link text in square brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). For example you can link your [home page](/).
