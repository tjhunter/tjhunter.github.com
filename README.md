## About

I am currently a software engineer at Databricks.

Prior to that, I did a Ph. D. in Machine Learning, in the 
Department of Computer Science at the
University of California at Berkeley. My advisors are [Pieter Abbeel](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Epabbeel/) and [Alexandre Bayen](http://lagrange.ce.berkeley.edu/bayen/).

In the course of my work, I have created or co-created a few projects around data science and Machine Learning.

- Koalas: provides pandas-like APIs on top of Apache Spark.

- Graphframes: a distributed graph processing interface built on top of Apache Spark

- spark-sklearn: a collection of wrappers around scikit-learn

- TensorFrames: a low-level integration between Google Tensorfow and Spark

- Deep Learning Pipelines: a Spark MLlib-like interface that provides Deep Learning capabilities to Apache Spark.
